# Rules of Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis

Big O notation is a way to measure how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the input grows. It helps us understand how fast or slow an algorithm is. Below are the main rules of Big O notation explained with examples:

## 1. Constant Time - O(1)
- The time taken by the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input.
- **Example:** Accessing an element in an array by its index.
  ```java
  int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
  System.out.println(arr[0]); // Always takes the same time, O(1)
## 2. Linear Time - O(n)
- The time taken grows directly with the size of the input.
- **Example:** Looping through an array.
```java 
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.println(arr[i]); // Time increases as n increases, O(n)
}
